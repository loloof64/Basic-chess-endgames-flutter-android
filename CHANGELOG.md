* Showing several errors at once instead of just the first error for scripts
* Caution ! The scripts checker does not warn you any more for being too restrictive
* (Android) (bug fix) : sometimes could not run long scripts
* (bug fix) : script types in some errors were not precise enough : sometimes we missed the piece kind
* (bug fix) : script error "parenthesis without expression" made program crash instead of reporting it
* (bug fix) : script error where there's a missing operand made program crash (same for wrong type of operand)
